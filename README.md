# Introduction

Malinda Miller ([@malindamiller](https://github.com/malindamiller)) and I developed a website for the Penn State Behrend Lion Ambassadors. We wanted to use a modern web development framework and we decided to use Ruby on Rails. The goal of the project was to develop an interface for the public to communicate with our organization. We implemented a "contact us" system so that website visitors can send messages to the club executive board.

# Overview

The user can click on different tabs to get to different parts of the website. The user can view our calendar (embedded Google Calendar), which is meant to be updated by our club executive board regularly. The user can go to the contact page to send a message to our club, which will be delivered to each executive board member email address.
