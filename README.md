# Introduction
Malinda Miller ([@malindamiller](https://github.com/malindamiller)) and I created a website for the Penn State Behrend Lion Ambassadors organization. We wanted to use a modern web development framework and we decided to use Ruby on Rails. The goal of the project was to create an interface for the public to communicate with our organization. We implemented a "contact us" system so that people can send messages to the club executive board.

# Basic Overview
The user can click on different tabs to get to different parts of the website. The user can view our calendar (embedded Google Calendar), which is meant to be updated by our club executive board when necessary. The user can go to the contact page to send a message to our club, which will be delivered to each executive board member email address.
